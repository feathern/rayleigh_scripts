# Scripts for Processing Rayleigh Data

This repository contains data-processing scripts that (a) I've found myself using on a semi-regular basis or (b) were complicated enough that I felt they warranted backing up.

If you happen across the page, feel free to use anything you find here, but know that these scripts are not supported as part of the main Rayleigh project.
